# ðŸ“œ PASCAL "Info NPC Extractor For SSEEdit Mantella - SPID - READ"

script for ssedit, with the function to extract information from the npc and utilsairlsa for Mantella, SPID or reading,

# What does it do?

they are 3 scripts for ssedti, which help with the extraction and management of information about the npc from different esp plugins, this allows you to have relevant data at hand to create elements in SPID, Mantella Adding NPCs Back History NG, or for whatever you deem convenient,

inside there are 3 scripts, when running the "Info NPC Extractor FULL.pas" you will obtain information from each npc of the plugin or if you selected various plugins at the base, this will show the following,

the script "Info NPC Extractor LITE.pas" will do the same but deliver less information to avoid having too many elements in management,

and the third is simply a script that deactivates the selected mod's NPCs with the invulnerability tag, this is because if one of the two previous scripts failed, or only damaged some of the NPCs and not all, you have to apply the deactivation of the invulnerable ones to run the script, after having the information you just have to exit without saving, it is a very particular case but it happens, the order itself the mod does not allow to have all the NPCs with information and presents some error in the console, apply the script "Info NPC Extractor Invulnerable Gone ESP.pas" and then any of the other two previous ones and you will get all the info of the mod, then exit without saving

# Acknowledgements

to all those who use the Mantella Adding NPCs Back History NG mod and its SKSE plugin, this is for you and for me, so you can get the information faster and also help in SPID and more things,
